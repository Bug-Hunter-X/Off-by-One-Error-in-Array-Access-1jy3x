This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java, specifically in array access. The original code has a loop condition that attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds.  The solution corrects the loop condition to prevent the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This example highlights the importance of careful array index management in Java to avoid runtime errors.
